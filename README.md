# Knowledge Garden
A Web Application that stores the issues and new experiences that the UI/SD developers faced during work.
Include Search feature, so other Company members can gain this information easily and prevent the wasting of time trying to solve the same issue.

The project is implemented using ASP.NET framework version 4.7 MVC, and for data access I used Entity framework and ADO.NET to communicate with Microsoft SQL-Server.

# Application Description:
The application consists of 6 screens
i.	User registration,
ii.	Login screen,
iii. View all problems,
iv. Create new problem info,
v. Edit old problem info,
vi. Delete old problem info.


## Installation
This project uses entity framework data base first approach in all the Problem's data tables that I created,
but the user login and registration are made using code first approach by Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC template :)

Important !!
Adjust the connection string in the web.config file to your database path
