# KnowedgeGarden
A Web Application that store the issues, new experience that the UI/SD developers faced during work.
Include Search feature, so other Company members can gain this information easily and prevent the wasting of time trying to solve the same issue. 

# Application Description:
The application consists of 4 screens
i.	User registration
ii.	Login screen
iii. View all problems
iv. Create new problem info
v. Edit old problem info
vi. Delete old problem info


## Installation
This project uses entity framework data base first approach in all the Problem's data tables that I created,
but the user login and registration are made using code first approach by Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC template :)

Important !!
Adjust the connection string in the web.config file to your database path
